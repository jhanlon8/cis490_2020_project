## San Marcos Litter Detection
#### CSUSM: Project Management & Practice
#### Instructor: Dr. Shaun-inn Wuu
#### Clients: Dr. Wesley Schultz & Dr. Kristin Stewart
#### Spring 2020 

## Project Outline
Building on fixIT's previous work the Stoic Solutions team was tasked with using their machine learning algorithm to process street images for the city of San Marcos.

## Guiding Questions

* How to collect latitude/longitude points throughout the city?
* Is it necessary to collect all four images from a panorama?
* Once we have the latitude/longitude files how should we process them?
* What information is relevant for the team creating the user interface?
* How do we get the data from the machine learning algorithm to the relational database?

## Things you will need
* Goole Street View API Key (For fetching images) [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* AWS Account (For storing data in a database) [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* Access to TrashTracker EC2 Instance (For processing images with tensorflow)
* An account with plotaroute.com [Plotaroute](https://www.plotaroute.com/routeplanner)
