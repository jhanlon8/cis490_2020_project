## San Marcos Litter Detection
### CSUSM: Project Management & Practice
### Instructor: Dr. Shaun-inn Wuu
### Clients: Dr. Wesley Schultz & Dr. Kristin Stewart
### Spring 2020 

## Project Outline
Building on fixIT's previous work the Stoic Solutions team was tasked with using their machine learning algorithm to process street images for the city of San Marcos.

## Guiding Questions

* How to collect latitude/longitude points throughout the city?
* Is it necessary to collect all four images from a panorama?
* Once we have the latitude/longitude files how should we process them?
* What information is relevant for the team creating the user interface?
* How do we get the data from the machine learning algorithm to the relational database?
